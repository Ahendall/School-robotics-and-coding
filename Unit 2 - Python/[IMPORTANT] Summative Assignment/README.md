## This is my summative project for Coding & Robotics 7, Unit 2: Python.
For this project, We made a Digital Adventure Story.
I Chose to make mine an Choose Your Own Story (CYOA) Version of ***Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith***.
You can download the .zip file of the project here.

A few things to note:

 - The Audio in this project has not been volume-adjusted. So Some audio
   files will be louder than others when you play it back
 - When the program plays an audio file, it will take a second to load.
 - You must type the option exactly as you see it (excluding letter cases)
 -  This requires [Python 3.9.4+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run properly. Please download it.
 - This requires the *simpleaudio API* to run properly. To download it:
	 1. Make sure you added Python 3.9.4 to PATH when installing.
	 2. Run this command in your Command Prompt (Terminal or Command line if you are on a Unix System)
